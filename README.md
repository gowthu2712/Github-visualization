Visualization for Github repositories

# Introduction



GitHub, the web-based Git repository hosting service, provides versioning control and source code management. With the management of source code and storage of different versions of a file, there are voluminous data available from GitHub waiting to be explored and to get insights from. Our project aims at visualizing this rich source of data from GitHub so that useful insights can be achieved. The visualizations are adaptive based on the audience and the viewers have complete control over what they want to drill down to. This aspect of dynamic user configurable visualization helps this project stand apart from the traditional visualization approaches. In this project work, we explore visualizations to answer questions related to Github users and repositories.
